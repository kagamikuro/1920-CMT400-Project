# 1920-CMT400-Project

Title:Performance Studies of a Parallel Cellular Automaton

Description:In this project you will investigate the performance of an existing parallel simulation of a cellular automaton written in C. The code has been parallelised using the MPI message passing library. You will be expected to time the code for differing numbers of processes and problem sizes on various parallel platforms, and also analyse the code to develop a mathematical performance model. You will also be expected to look for opportunities to optimise the code.
